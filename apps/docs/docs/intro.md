# Introduction

Stayte is a library that helps you to create persistent state in your application by using every possible peristent storage (cookies, query, local storage or session storage) in natural way.

tired to re-invent the wheel at every new project, Stayte is here to help you to save time and effort.

It's inspired by the concept of signal and it's a great fit for React applications, but it can be used in any JavaScript application.

Stayte could also be used in the server side by applying a simple patch (only next.js is supported for now).
