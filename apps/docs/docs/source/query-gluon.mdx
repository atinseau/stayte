# Query gluon

The query gluon is a gluon that is persisted in the query string of the url.

It is fully compatible with server side rendering, it's mean you can use the value
of the gluon directly in your server side code and stayte will be able to hydrate
the value from the query string on the client side.

:::warning
Actually, the only framework that is supported is **next.js**, but you can use it in any framework just by
importing the component or the gluon only in the client side (no ssr) and also it's only working in 
dynamic rendering mode.
:::

## Usage

```js
import { gluon } from "stayte";

const countGluon = gluon('count', {
  from: 'query',
  defaultValue: 10
})
```
