# Concept


## What is a "persistent state" ?

A persistent state is a state that is stored in a place that is not destroyed when the application is closed, like
a page reload or a tab close.

There is many different area that is used to store a peristent state

- [Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) (client)
- [Session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) (client)
- [Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies) (SSR)
- [Query string](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) (SSR)


In many project, as a developer, you will need to interact with a peristent state
by using the native browser API or by using a library

***Problem***, there is no library that regroup all peristent state in one place, with a unified API.

Stayte is here to help you to save time and effort.

## What is a "gluon" ?

A gluon is the smallest unit of stayte, it's a class used to interact with every peristent state.

He's able to ***subscribe*** to changes, ***set*** a value and ***get*** the value.

It's look like a signal from preact

Also a gluon can be composed of other gluons and make a chain of reaction.

:::info
The name "gluon" is inspired by the physical [gluon](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon), it's a quantum particle that is responsible of the link between the quarks.
