# Advanced usage

## Computed value

A gluon can be computed from other gluons, this is useful when you want to compute a value based on other values.

To do that, you need to use the `computed` function:

```js
import { countGluon } from "./gluon";
import { computed } from "stayte";

const doubleGluon = computed(() => countGluon.get() * 2, [countGluon])

const unsubscribe = doubleGluon.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log(value) // 20, 40 (and no more)
})

countGluon.set(10) // <-- this will trigger the callback
countGluon.set(20) // <-- this will trigger the callback

unsubscribe()

countGluon.set(30) // <-- this will not trigger the callback
```

`computed` method return a `ReadGluon`, so you can use it as usual (subscribe, get, useGluon, etc...) but a `ReadGluon`
cannot be set, it's mean you cannot update the value of a computed gluon.

Also a `ReadGluon` is not persistent, it's mean the callback will be executed everytime the application
or the context is reloaded.

:::info
Actually `computed` is not able to detect automatically the dependencies 
inside the callback, so you need to pass the dependencies as second argument.

## Schema validation

Stayte is using [zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the default value, the initial value from the source and every new value set by the user of the gluon.

If there is a schema provided in the configuration object, the value will be validated against the schema.

If the value is not valid, the gluon switch to an **error mode**
