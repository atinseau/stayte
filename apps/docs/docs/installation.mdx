# Installation

## Getting Started

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun" default>

To install stayte, go to your project folder and add the following line to your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "trustedDependencies": [
    "stayte"
  ],
}
```

And then run:

```bash
bun add stayte zod
```
  </TabItem>



  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
Create or add a `.npmrc` file in the root of your project and add the following line:
``` ini title=".npmrc"
enable-pre-post-scripts=true
side-effects-cache=false
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm add stayte zod
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
  Npm doesn't support the patching mechanism

  So it's not supported yet...
  </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

  Yarn install documentation is not available yet...

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

***Note:*** For now you need to install zod manually because stayte doesn't include it in its bundle and it's a requirement 
to use the library ***(in the future, stayte will be able to be used without zod)***


Now you can use stayte in your project by importing it:

```js
import { ... } from "stayte";
```



## Next.js

If you are using **next.js**, a patch will be automatically applied to your project, you don't need to do anything. If you want to check the patch, you can find every patch [here](https://github.com/atinseau/stayte/tree/master/packages/stayte/patches).

Statye actually only work in dynamic rendering mode, so if you are using static rendering, unexpected behavior will appear.

***Note:*** Stayte is only available since **next.js** 14.2.13 and above.
if you are using an older version, leave a message in the [issues](https://github.com/atinseau/stayte/issues) and I will try to update the patch.

:::warning
Sometimes, your package manager don't directly apply the patch, in this case, just run the command
to install the dependencies and the patch will be applied automatically.
